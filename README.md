Got it 👍 — the problem is that in your current README draft, the **Markdown formatting broke** because:

1. You didn’t close the code block (`bash … `), so everything after it was rendered as plain text.
2. Headings (`##`, `###`) weren’t properly spaced.
3. Lists weren’t indented with correct Markdown syntax.

Here’s a **clean, fully fixed `README.md`** you can directly paste into GitHub — formatting will work correctly this time:

# Hybrid Deep Learning for Lung Sound Classification

This repository contains the **major project** for classifying lung sounds using a **hybrid deep learning approach (CNN + LSTM)**. The project was carried out as part of the B.Tech program in **Computer Science Engineering (AI & DS)**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Detect and classify lung sounds (normal, crackles, wheezes, combined) from audio recordings to assist in early diagnosis of respiratory diseases.  
- **Methodology:**  
  - Convert audio signals into **spectrograms** for feature representation.  
  - Use **ResNet-18** as the CNN backbone for feature extraction.  
  - Use **LSTM** to capture temporal dependencies across audio sequences.  
  - Train with **focal loss** to address dataset imbalance.

## ⚙️ How to Run the Notebook

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harsh-ydv8/-Hybrid-Deep-Learning-for-Lung-Sound-Classification.git
   cd -Hybrid-Deep-Learning-for-Lung-Sound-Classification
````

2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook majorproject.ipynb
   ```

3. **Run the notebook cells** sequentially to reproduce preprocessing, training, and evaluation steps.

   > ⚠️ **Note:** The dataset is not included in this repo.
   > Download the [ICBHI 2017 Respiratory Sound Database](https://bhichallenge.med.auth.gr/ICBHI_2017_Challenge) and update dataset paths in the notebook.
